# Ping_listener
A backend that sends emails in case ping is not received within the specified time

## Server config template
Frequency is refered to as a delay in seconds between processing loops.

  {  
  '**server_root**':(str) Deprecated. Gets overwritten during initialization 'https://example.net' a prefix string  
    to insert into logs link in the alert emails;  
  '**base_frequency**': (scalar>=0) a delay between the steps of a ping absence listener;  
  '**email_processing_frequency**': (scalar>=0) a delay before the next processing of the emails queue;  
  '**recipient**': (str or list(str)) representing the recipient email or list of emails;  
  '**users**': a dict of pairs (username:(unique str),user config described below)  
  }

  '**max_sleep**': (scalar>=0) max delay between pings in seconds;  
  '**device_email**': (str or list(str)) Optional. Represents a device-specific email or list of emails.
